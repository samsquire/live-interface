# Living Documents

## WHAT

A living document is the fusion of data sources and GUIs to create a flexible user powered environment for combining, storing and operating on data and other systems.



## Write a review

Imagine you are a reviewer.

You want to track products, manufacturers, ratings and links.

You do this with plaintext.



## Product research

Imagine you're looking for a product to buy for your company

You tailor a set of must-haves and nice-to-haves.

You evaluate products, listing features and write about how it meets your criteria.

You do this with sentences or bullet points.



## Document a	 development environment

Imagine you join a project that uses a wiki, a README and spreadsheets

You maintain hostnames, credentials in different systems.

You do this with configuration management systems, with lists and with password databases.



## Trapped and Surrounded

There is data around us. Data we would use if we knew we did not have to trap it in purpose built systems.

Data should be easy to capture, mix and interact with.



## Static

We put our information into to-do lists, into Twitter,  into Facebook, into blog posts, into spreadsheets, into HTML and into word processors where it stays and never leaves.



## Transclusion

A core tenet of living document is transclusion.

I should be able to put anything I want on the screen.



## What If

Every thing on your screen:

 * was a microservice
 * could be separately identified
 * can be re-used



 
## Templating for the masses

A living document makes template language features accessible.

Inserting data from different sources and querying data should be seamless.



## Like Programs

Programs resolve dependencies at runtime.

But with living documents, not all dependencies need to be resolved.

Some dependencies are completely optional. They're completeley made up.



## Completely made up?

Most tools force you to make decisions at input time.

What if you don't want to select a 

We can make up features of our document by marking up documents as we see fit.

We can enrich documents as we go or in the future.



## Many visualizations

We can display and interact with a document in multiple ways.

 * as an outliner
 * as a spreadsheet
 * as data
 * as a graph



## Timeline

Living documents are not linear and do not stand alone.

Living documents can be viewed in a chronological timeline.



## Composition

A document usually has a hierarchy or structure.

We can nest contexts in other contexts.

For example, we can have a list of reviews which each have their own rating.

These relationships can be defined separately.



## Representations

In addition to transforming contexts in a pipeline, contexts can have multiple forms.

A context does not necessarily have a single representation.



## Divergent writing

Users can stop what they are doing and create a sub-element immediately.



## Loose decisions

We do not want to force a decision on a user on:

 * what programming languages can be used for extension
 * whether or not the document is statically or dynamically generated




## Existing technologies

Living documents aims to take advantage of existing technologies.

 * existing templating languages
 * no insistence of any given web framework
 * HATEOAS
 * existing package managers
 * enterprise transformation tools
 * parsers



## Context interaction

Depending on the type of data, there may be operations that can be used.

These can result in further contexts for transclusion.



## Influences

 * stream processing/pipelines: each item on the screen acts as a producer and consumer of data
 * Service Oriented Architecture



## Shell Bucket

Pipe data into a shell bucket.

Create an interface to interact with the output.

We can annotate the output so it makes sense, perhaps using conventional parsing technologies.



## Flexible Interfaces

The living document interface takes inspiration from different systems.

 * tiling window managers
 * metro style card layouts
